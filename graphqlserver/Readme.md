# TypeScript and GraphQL Integration with Apollo Server

This document summarizes the TypeScript code integrating GraphQL with Apollo Server.

## Code Summary

### 1. Importing Apollo Server Modules
- Import `ApolloServer` from `@apollo/server`.
- Import `startStandaloneServer` from `@apollo/server/standalone`.

### 2. Defining Sample Data
- Create an array `books` containing objects with `title` and `author` properties.

### 3. Defining GraphQL Schema (`typeDefs`)
- Define a GraphQL schema with type definitions (`typeDefs`).
- Include a `Book` type with `title` and `author` fields, both of type `String`.
- Define a `Query` type with a `books` field that returns an array of `Book` types.

### 4. Setting Up Resolvers
- Define resolvers to specify how to fetch data for each type in the schema.
- Implement a resolver for the `books` query that returns the `books` array.

### 5. Creating an Apollo Server Instance
- Instantiate `ApolloServer` with the defined `typeDefs` and `resolvers`.

### 6. Starting the Server with `startStandaloneServer`
- Use `startStandaloneServer` to set up and start the server.
- Configure the server to listen on port 4000.

### 7. Logging Server Start
- Log a message to the console when the server is ready, displaying the server URL.

## Conclusion

This code sets up a basic GraphQL server using Apollo Server in TypeScript. It defines a simple GraphQL schema with a `Book` type and a `Query` type for retrieving an array of books. The server is configured to listen on port 4000, and upon starting, it logs the URL where it can be accessed. This setup is ideal for learning the basics of GraphQL and Apollo Server integration
